//! # Consensus Module for CoinCync 1.0
//!
//! RandomX-only Proof of Work consensus with:
//! - Single algorithm (RandomX)
//! - Dual-Anchor ASERT-i3-2d difficulty adjustment (see difficulty.rs)
//! - Asymptotic-with-tail emission curve (see emission/curve.rs)
//!
//! AUDIT (2026-07-02 line-by-line pass): fixed two stale doc claims here.
//! Previous version said "LWMA difficulty adjustment" — that has been
//! ASERT-i3-2d since well before v1.0.0 and the algorithm-tag was never
//! updated in this docstring. difficulty.rs's own module header names
//! the algorithm correctly. Same class of doc-vs-code drift as the
//! ring_selection.rs gamma cleanup landed in a1b62ec6. Also renamed
//! "Halving emission curve" to "Asymptotic-with-tail" because that's
//! what emission/curve.rs actually implements — see base_reward_from_supply
//! (remaining / EMISSION_DIVISOR, floored at TAIL_EMISSION); there's no
//! discrete halving event, the curve is continuous with a tail floor.
