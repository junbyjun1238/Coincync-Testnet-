// ═══ HYBRID REORG DEFENSE (H-16 FIX) ═══════════════════════════════════════
//
// Three-tier defense against deep chain reorganizations:
//
// Tier 1 (depth ≤ 10): Unconditional acceptance if fork has more work.
//   Normal network jitter, race conditions, brief connectivity issues.
//   Standard Nakamoto longest-chain rule applies.
//
// Tier 2 (depth 11-100): MESS-style exponential cost multiplier.
//   Fork must demonstrate SIGNIFICANTLY more cumulative work to be accepted.
//   Required work multiplier = 2^((depth - 10) / 20)
//   At depth 30: fork needs 2x honest chain's work
//   At depth 50: fork needs 4x
//   At depth 70: fork needs 8x
//   At depth 90: fork needs 16x
//   This makes rental-hashrate attacks economically infeasible at depth.
//
// Tier 3 (depth > 100): Hard reject. Absolute finality.
//   No amount of work can reorg past this depth.
//   Combined with rolling checkpoints for defense in depth.
//
// Historical precedent:
//   - ETC 2019: 100+ block reorg, $1.1M double-spend
//   - Bitcoin Gold 2018: deep reorg, $18M stolen
//   - Horizen 2018: deep reorg, $550K stolen
//   All were low-hashrate PoW chains without progressive reorg resistance.
//
// Reference: Ethereum Classic MESS (EIP-ECIP-1100)

/// shape of the ring-size bootstrap relaxation (`BOOTSTRAP_MIN_RING_SIZE`): a

    /// every block in the window were uncached (worst case during a deep
    /// reorg-replay), each lookup adds ~one sled `get()` of <1 ms, capping
    /// the full scan at ~2 seconds — still acceptable for a once-per-block
    /// invocation, but worth noting that the "O(1) per lookup" claim
    /// assumes hot cache.
    ///
    /// No memoization yet; if profiling shows this on a hot path, the
    /// per-window count is trivially memoizable since it only changes by
    /// ±1 when a new block lands (or a reorg unwinds + replays). A
    /// single read-lock-held-across-the-whole-scan variant would also
    /// shave ~300 µs vs the current per-block acquire pattern. Both
    /// optimizations are YAGNI right now — BIP-9 query is one-per-block
    /// at most, dwarfed by the RandomX + Bulletproof costs of validation.
    ///
    /// ## Missing-block handling
    ///
    /// A height that maps to no block (gap in the chain, e.g. during
    /// reorg-rollback) is skipped without error — counts as 0 contribution.
    /// A block whose coinbase is missing (impossible by construction, but

// USE FROM ASYNC CONTEXTS. The sync versions remain for:
//   - RPC handlers using `block_in_place` (jsonrpsee register_method
//     closures are sync; `block_in_place` is the right primitive there)
//   - Truly synchronous code (mining loop, tests, validator unit tests)
//   - Internal helpers themselves called from inside spawn_blocking
//
// All wrappers take `self: Arc<Self>` so the caller passes an Arc clone
// — required for `spawn_blocking`'s `'static + Send` bound. Cheap:
// atomic refcount bump only.
